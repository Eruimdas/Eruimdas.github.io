*Let's start with a little smile :)*

Hello everyone ðŸ˜‡,

I'm Hasan and I'll be your host during your visit to this blog :) Actually, in this post, you'll find general information about me and what I do for a living. 

I was really thinking about opening a blog for myself -and I've tried once, but I couldn't have time to make it work- and now as a new year resolution, I've started to make it real. I'm a double major engineer -Computer and Mechatronics-. Currently, I'm working at [Carbon Consulting](http://carbonconsulting.com/) as Senior Machine Learning Engineer. It is really fun for me to be an ML Eng. probably because there's always different problems which vary on projects and my job never repeats itself - yaay!-. From time to time, I'm also taking on some responsibilities as an "Analyst" to gain wider experience over the problems I'm working with. I also believe that at some point having/learning analyst skills can help the developers to have a better understanding of the project they're working on. According to my experiences on the subject. And at the end of the day, there lie different challenges waiting to be solved, so why not take a look at them ðŸ˜€.

Oh, I was almost forgetting, except being one of the most humble human-being in this blog ðŸ˜‰, I've also won the first NLP-based hackathon in Turkey with a team of 5 which resulted in a company called _Summarify_. I've worked for almost one year as CTO & Co-Founder, and left -will not talk about reasons- after we've won another reward from the government -TUBITAK 1512 or BIGG-. 

Also, if you're interested, you're always welcome to read my publications, which you can find backlinks from my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Eruimdas/) or from [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cuU1gNMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Well, to make it no longer, let's wrap everything up while talking about the reason why I've opened a blog page. First of all -to be honest- my GitHub profile is not the way I want it to be. I like to help people as an inspiration or helper for them. So, why not I'll try to share my knowledge? Of course, from time to time, I'm writing some posts in [Medium](https://medium.com/@hasan.kemik), but that's it. And I like to use Medium for informative posts only. However, as doing so I started to think that people might think that I'm a ghostwriter or so ðŸ˜„. This ends today! -I hope at least.- 

The main usage of this blog will be for some planned open-source repositories and their explanations. I've set myself a goal of **At least 1 problem every day** and I'll try to commit at least 1 problem solving from hackerrank, leetcode or etc., and every week, I'll write a blog post for the approach that I've taken and why I chose it. As always, I'll also try to use my best software-development knowledge to keep this repository clean -This blog is hosted by GitHub, and at the end, it's a git repository.- however, if you'll check you can see that I'm still committing to the `main` branch. My friends, everything will be fixed soon :)

And as a start to a long journey,\
Take care of yourselves,\
Best wishes,\
Hasan.
