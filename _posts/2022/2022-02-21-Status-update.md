Allright, let's get directly into the topic. I couldn't keep up with my promise to myself on the latest post. Here I'll try to find it's reasons while writing this one.

So, what was my first thing to do... HackerRank. Where am I on it right now? I've just -5 min ago- deleted the code repository and post branch for it. Because I'm currently overwhelmed with a TON of things. I also don't think that if I had really wanted I might be able to do it, but at the end of the day that level of exhaustness was keeping me in a lying position. Here are my execuses for everything I couldn't do. I cannot end my job after work hours so it's always keeping me busy. -It's not because I'm not good enough to complete the tasks, it's because I cannot stop thinking over them.- Hence, when I try to read a book or play a game, I can still mainly think over the task I cannot really enjoy what I'm doing. When I look back into that, it feels like if I couldn't enjoy it, at least I could've done what I was thinking and because I was doing another think I didn't do that also and etc. etc. 

When this all of this kind of stuff gets together, it becomes really annoying. Also, I'm currently trying to prepare of my Master's Degree and try to get into one of the best universities in Turkey. Hey there another stress bringer :) Let's leave them all aside, in weekends I'm trying to manage a bootcamp with a non-profit-organization Kodluyoruz and Carbon to make sure everyone is learning something new. I'm evaluating homeworks, attending classes, helping my colleagues if they've stuck or sth. else is happened. 

All of this actually results into less and less self time. I've even stopped to read some graphical novels or sci-fi books because I think that it'd be better to read Jurafsky's "Speech and Language Processing" would be more helpful. Oh, did I mention that I also want to write an academic paper. Yeah, that's still a "want" because I couldn't even properly created one out of my latest thesis. -Which I genuinely believe it could be accepted by a journal.- 

At the end of the day it results into this, I'm a human being who wants to have a hobby, get better at work, and much more. -Did I mentioned that I'm living in Turkey? For those who have no idea, if a news can survive two days, it's probably about WW3.-  I don't know actually, I feel like I'm still trying to prioritize what I want to do in my life and it's making me stressfull. I cannot handle that much stress easily. 

Okey, let's not make this blog as a wailing wall, I still want to create good stuff for this page and I mean it. Just wanted to share what I'm feeling right now. And as a last word, for the blow-off-steam category, I'll not check any grammer mistakes or typos because these posts will always have a free spirit. I might delete or hide them actually I don't know. We'll see what the future holds...

Take care of yourselves,\
Best wishes,\
Hasan.
